  abstract     = {{Modern transient astrophysics greatly benefits from the 
                 real-time collation and management of many heterogeneous 
                 data streams to allocate finite follow-up resources. Efficient 
                 management of this information enhances the ability to extract 
                 useful transient science. YSE-PZ is an open-source, general-purpose 
                 Target and Observation Management (TOM) platform that ingests a live 
                 stream of transient discovery alerts, resolves those transients 
                 to host galaxies, downloads coincident archival data, and retrieves 
                 forced photometry from a variety of online sources. YSE-PZ supports 
                 group-level data permissions and is currently used by the Young 
                 Supernova Experiment, the Keck Infrared Transient Survey, and Dark 
                 Energy Bedrock All Sky Supernovae team. YSE-PZ exposes many observing 
                 tools to coordinate follow-up observations, including generating airmass 
                 plots, finding charts, and front-end forms to trigger follow-up 
                 observations. YSE-PZ supports a rich set of query tools that allow users 
                 to explore the database and generate personalized dashboards to track transients 
                 of interest. YSE-PZ is currently hosted by the UC Santa Cruz Transients 
                 team but is built to be flexibly deployed and can be easily installed 
                 in a local instance or the cloud.}},
