Welcome to the YSE_PZ documentation!
====================================
Modern transient astrophysics greatly benefits from the real-time collation
and management of many heterogeneous data streams to allocate finite follow-up
resources. Efficient management of this information enhances the ability to extract
useful transient science. YSE-PZ is an open-source, general-purpose Target and
Observation Management (TOM) platform that ingests a live stream of transient
discovery alerts, resolves those transients to host galaxies, downloads coincident
archival data, and retrieves forced photometry from a variety of online sources.
YSE-PZ supports group-level data permissions and is currently used by the Young
Supernova Experiment, the Keck Infrared Transient Survey, and Dark Energy Bedrock
All Sky Supernovae team. YSE-PZ exposes many observing tools to coordinate follow-up
observations, including generating airmass plots, finding charts, and front-end forms
to trigger follow-up observations. YSE-PZ supports a rich set of query tools that
allow users to explore the database and generate personalized dashboards to track
transients of interest. YSE-PZ is currently hosted by the UC Santa Cruz Transients
team but is built to be flexibly deployed and can be easily installed in a local
instance or the cloud.
