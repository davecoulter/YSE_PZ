Status Tags
***********

This page describes the various follow-up and observing status tags that can
be assigned to a transient in YSE_PZ.

* :code:`New` - Object recently discovered and unsorted. Nobody should ever
  manually assign something to this category.
* :code:`Watch` - Object that may be targeted for follow-up observations. This
  is the primary category assigned during triage.
* :code:`Interesting` - Particularly interesting objects that may be targeted
  for follow-up observations.
* :code:`FollowupRequested` - Object with no dedicated follow-up observation
  yet obtained, but a request has been made.
* :code:`Following` - Objects actively being followed with non-survey
  observations. At least one dedicated observation is necessary for this tag.
* :code:`NeedsTemplate` - Object with dedicated follow-up observations that will
  not get additional observations of the transient, but where template
  observations are required.
* :code:`FollowupFinished` - Object with dedicated follow-up observations that
  will not get additional observations of the transient, and no additional
  template observations are required.
* :code:`Ignore` - All objects where no follow-up observations have been
  obtained and none will be obtained.
