Docker
******

This pages walks you through running :code:`YSE_PZ` locally. You might want to
do this if you want to develop on :code:`YSE_PZ`. The strongly recommended
(and only supported) way to run :code:`YSE_PZ` locally is to use docker.
You could attempt to install :code:`YSE_PZ` natively (instructions at the bottom
of this page for archival reasons) but this will likely be an order of magnitude
harder than using docker.


Install the Docker desktop app
-------------------------------

The first step is to install the docker desktop application, which can be found
`here <https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/>`_ for your system. The recommended
docker resources required to run :code:`YSE_PZ` are:

* System memory: >= 8 GB
* Docker memory: >= 4 GB
* Docker CPU >= 1
* Docker Swap >= 1 GB
* Docker Disk Image Size >= 20 GB

These requirements can be set in the docker desktop app
(Preferences > Resources).

Settings file
-------------

In order for :code:`YSE_PZ` to work, a :code:`settings.ini` needs to be created
in the :code:`YSE_PZ/YSE_PZ/` directory. This file contains all the YSE_PZ
configuration settings and can also contain secrets needed to access external
services. To create a minimum working settings file, you can just copy and
rename the :code:`public_settings.ini` file. From the base :code:`YSE_PZ`
directory run,

.. code:: none

    cp YSE_PZ/public_settings.ini YSE_PZ/settings.ini

Environment file
----------------

For docker compose to run :code:`YSE_PZ` environment
variables like systems ports and volumes need to be set. This is done by
creating a :code:`.env` file in the :code:`YSE_PZ/docker` directory.

The :code:`.env` should have the following variables set:

* :code:`VOL`

The local path to the root of this repository -- will be mapped to /app in the
docker web image

* :code:`VOL_DB`

The local path to the mysql files, e.g.: "local proj path/docker_mysql/8.0"

* :code:`DB_PWD`

The root database password

* :code:`STATIC_VOL`

The path YSE_PZ app's static directory

* :code:`LOCAL_DB_HOST`

Configurable - this should be set to whatever port you want docker forwarding
it’s database container port 3306 on.

* :code:`LOCAL_HTTP_PORT`

Configurable - this should be set to whatever port you want docker forwarding
it’s nginx container port 80 on.

* :code:`DJANGO_SUPERUSER_USERNAME`

This is the django and yse_pz superuser username that will be created on startup.
You use this to log into the YSE_PZ website and the django admin dashboard.

* :code:`DJANGO_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD`

This is the django and yse_pz superuser password that will be created on startup.
You use this to log into the YSE_PZ website and the django admin dashboard.

* :code:`DJANGO_SUPERUSER_EMAIL`

This is the django and yse_pz superuser email that will be created on startup.

* :code:`VOL_DB_LOG`

The local path to map the mysql log files for debug purposes.
It is recommended to put this at the same level (but in a different directory) as :code:`VOL_DB`

* :code:`VOL_GHOST`

The directory for the GHOST plugin to serialize its working log. It is recommended to put this in a different directory
to :code:`VOL` to prevent Git issues.

An example of a minimum working .env file would be

.. code:: none

    VOL= ../
    VOL_DB=../database/
    DB_PWD=password
    STATIC_VOL=../YSE_PZ/static/
    LOCAL_DB_PORT=53306
    LOCAL_HTTP_PORT=80
    DJANGO_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD = password123
    DJANGO_SUPERUSER_USERNAME = admin123
    DJANGO_SUPERUSER_EMAIL = test@gamil.com
    VOL_DB_LOG= ../databaes_logs/
    VOL_GHOST= ../ghost_logs/

To get a minimum working .env file simply copy and rename the :code:`docker/public.env`
From the base YSE_PZ directory run

.. code:: none

    cp docker/public.env docker/.env


Running the docker containers
-----------------------------

To run the docker containers, in the :code:`YSE_PZ/docker/` directory run

.. code:: none

    docker compose up

To bring the docker container stack down, in the :code:`YSE_PZ/docker/`
directory run

.. code:: none

    docker compose down

Static files
------------

To get YSE_PZ to see all the statics file run the following:

.. code:: none

    docker exec -it ysepz_web_container bash

Then in the docker container run,

.. code::

    python3 manage.py collectstatic

and type :code:`yes` if asked about overwriting existing static files.
To exit the docker container, run

.. code::

    exit

Adding a superuser
------------------

In order to be able to log into :code:`YSE_PZ` you need to create a superuser.
To do this, run the following command,

.. code:: none

    docker exec -it ysepz_web_container bash -c 'python3 manage.py createsuperuser --noinput'

This command will create a superuser with the username and password defined in
the :code:`.env` file.

Viewing webpages
----------------

Whilst the docker container stack is running go to
`http://0.0.0.0/login/ <http://0.0.0.0/login/>`_ in your web browser
and :code:`YSE_PZ` should be running.

Native
******

.. warning::
    The following native install instructions are here for archival purposes
    only. We strongly discourage you from using these instructions.

This is a easy guide to performing a local installation of :code:`YSE_PZ`.

Prerequisites
=============

MySQL
-----

If you don't already have MySQL, it's easy to get it
using Homebrew.  To get homebrew, run::

  /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

Then to install and start MySQL::

  brew install mysql

Check your :code:`MySQL` version with::

  mysql --version

If you're running version 5, you should try
to upgrade to :code:`MySQL` version 8 if possible::

  brew upgrade mysql

After that, start the :code:`MySQL` server with::

  brew tap homebrew/services
  brew services start mysql

Then set up your root password::

  mysqladmin -u root password 'yourpassword'

Make sure to put single quotes around your password!

Anaconda Python
---------------
`<http://anaconda.org>`_

Database File and settings.ini file
-----------------------------------
If you're a YSE or UCSC team member (or other collaborator),
ask D. Jones for these files.  Otherwise, you can use the
public versions of the YSE_PZ database (updated approximately
whenever I feel like it, or please ask for the latest and greatest),
which are :code:`YSE_PZ/public_settings.ini` for the settings file
and follow this `Dropbox link <https://www.dropbox.com/s/fc6fnmrelds92nq/YSE_db_public_20210208.sql.tgz?dl=0>`_
for the database.

If you don't need to ingest any new transients into the database, you
can copy this file over to :code:`YSE_PZ/settings.ini` and you're
good to go!  Otherwise, *still* copy the file over and then see
the :ref:`ysecrons` to finish the setup.


Installing the YSE_PZ Code
==========================

Should be straightforward::

   git clone https://github.com/davecoulter/YSE_PZ.git
   cd YSE_PZ
   conda env create -f yse_pz.yml
   conda activate yse_pz
   pip install -r requirements.txt

Put the :code:`settings.ini` file in the :code:`YSE_PZ/`
directory (**not** the main repository directory, the directory
with the same name one level down).

Please note that sometimes the extinction module is buggy.
It is needed for some functionality but I would 
recommend trying to install it last.

Alternatively, I haven't tried this myself, but - the latest YSE_PZ conda environment from my mac
is included as :code:`yse_pz_latest.yml`, so to avoid pip as
much as possible you can try::

  conda env create -f yse_pz_latest.yml
  conda activate yse_pz
  
Starting the Web Server
=======================

In the YSE_PZ directory, run::

  python manage.py migrate
  python manage.py runserver

Then in a web browser on your computer,
go to the url `<http://127.0.0.1:8000>`_.  If you're initializing
from the public database, the only existing user is :code:`admin`
and the password is set to :code:`changeme`.  Users are easy to create
from the `<http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin>`_ page.  After that, you
should be good to go!

Setting up the YSE-PZ Crons
===========================

Running YSE-PZ as a living database that ingests
new transient data requires setting up two crons
to add new transients from the Transient Name Server
and ingest new ZTF data from MARS.  Ingesting new
ZTF data for existing transients from MARS is relatively
easy, while creating new transients from TNS requires
setting up a TNS "bot" for yourself or your group at
`<https://wis-tns.weizmann.ac.il/bots>`_.  See the TNS bulk
reports manual at `<https://wis-tns.weizmann.ac.il/sites/default/files/api/TNS_bulk_reports_manual.pdf>`_
for more information.  Once the API key has been set up,
paste the key into the :code:`tnsapikey=` line in the :code:`YSE_PZ/settings.ini`
file.

There are sometimes errors related to ingesting new transients,
and for this reason it helps to link an email address to an account
where error messages can be sent.  This is the :code:`dbemail` key in
the :code:`YSE_PZ/settings.ini` file.  Unfortunately, to *send* those
emails, you need to link an email account to YSE_PZ.  You can
do this by setting :code:`SMTP_LOGIN` and :code:`SMTP_PASSWORD`
in the :code:`SMTP_provider` section of the :code:`settings.ini` file
to your email username and password (you'll need to change :code:`SMTP_HOST` if the
account is not gmail).  You'll also have to allow access to less secure
apps in google, which is easy to find instructions for online.

Once all this has been set up, you can run the TNS cron with::

  python manage.py runcrons YSE_App.data_ingest.TNS_uploads.TNS_recent --force

Every time you run this command (manually or with a cron, e.g., `<https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/crontab.5.html>`_),
this will grab transients uploaded to TNS or updated within the last day.  To change the time interval (in YSE, we do
this every three minutes), change the :code:`tns_recent_ndays` parameter in the settings.ini file.

Finally, to get new ZTF or TNS photometry/spectra for objects, the following cron will grab everything for
transients with the statuses :code:`Watch`, :code:`Interesting`:, :code:`FollowupRequested`, :code:`Following`,
or :code:`FollowupFinished`::

  python manage.py runcrons YSE_App.data_ingest.TNS_uploads.TNS_updates --force

For everything marked as :code:`Ignore` for transients modified in the last 30 days, run this one::

  python manage.py runcrons YSE_App.data_ingest.TNS_uploads.TNS_Ignore_updates --force

This can be a *ton* of transients, so it's best not to run this too often.
